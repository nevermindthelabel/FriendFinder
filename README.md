### Description
FriendFinder is our first Full Stack Application, using [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for server side scripting, [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) to create our server, [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) to handle click events and ajax, [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) to create a modal and handle styling elements along with CSS, and HTML to create our pages.

In FriendFinder a user enters a name and a link to a photo, and answers a list of questions. The results are compared on a question by question basis and compared to other users, with the photo of the closest match displaying in a modal once the submit button is clicked and the data is returned to the front end.
